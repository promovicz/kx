## KX for K6 in C

The language K is a semi-tacit array language, invented by Arthur Whitney based on APL by Ken Iverson.

K is for people who want to write programs that are as short and dense as math formulas.

This project is a set of extensions for K systems implementing the `ktye/i:+/k.h` interface.
